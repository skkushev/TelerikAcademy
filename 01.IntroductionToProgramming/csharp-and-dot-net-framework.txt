.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library known
as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. 
Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), 
an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework.
