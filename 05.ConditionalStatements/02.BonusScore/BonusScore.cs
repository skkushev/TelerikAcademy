/*Problem 2. Bonus Score

Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range [1…9] by the following rules:
If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints “invalid score”.
Examples:

score	result
2	    20
4	    400
9	    9000
-1	    invalid score
10	    invalid score*/

using System;

class BonusScore
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Give score from 1 to 9");
        int score = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        switch (score)
        {
            case 1:
            case 2:
            case 3:
                Console.WriteLine(score * 10);
                break;
            case 4:
            case 5:
            case 6:
                Console.WriteLine(score * 100);
                break;
            case 7:
            case 8:
            case 9:
                Console.WriteLine(score * 1000);
                break;
            default:
                Console.WriteLine("Invalid score");
                break;
