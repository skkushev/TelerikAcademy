/*Problem 14.* Print the ASCII Table

Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints the entire ASCII table of characters on the console (characters from 0 to 255). 
Note: Some characters have a special purpose and will not be displayed as expected. You may skip them or display them differently.
Note: You may need to use for-loops (learn in Internet how).*/

using System;

class PrintTheASCII
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (byte i = 0; i < 255; i++)
        {
            char symbol = (char)i;
            Console.Write(symbol + " ");
        }
    }
}
